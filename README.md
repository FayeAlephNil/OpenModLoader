This process is for setting up Open Mod Loader as a project developer and should not be used for writing your own mods. There is currently no setup for authoring mods.

2. Run `gradlew setupOML genIdeaRuns --refresh-dependencies` in the cloned repository folder.
3. Open IntelliJ on the repository folder.
